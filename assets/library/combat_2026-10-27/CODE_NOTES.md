# Modular combat anims (2026-10-27)

Gentle, never violent. Body frames are weaponless; attach sword/bow/wand at the hand anchor.

## Keeper body — `assets/art/battle/modular/keeper/<clip>/frame_0000..0003.png`
Clips: **attack, hit, brace, cast, spare** (4 frames each, 128², sole ~123, east-facing).
~100–120 ms/frame. Derived from live battle stills (open-hand attack already weaponless).

## Weapons — `assets/art/battle/modular/weapons/`
- `sword.png` (14×6), `bow.png` (8×12), `wand.png` (3×12)
- Convenience: `weapons/sword_attack/frame_0000..0003.png` pre-placed on 128² canvas for the attack clip.

## Hand-anchor table
Columns: actor, clip, frame, hand_x, hand_y, rot_index (0 = tip east / no rot), z (front|behind body).
Place weapon so its **grip pixel** sits on (hand_x, hand_y).

## Budget note
Keeper + Imp shipped. Elaia attack/cast partial if present on main. Puff / moss_tortoise combat deferred.
